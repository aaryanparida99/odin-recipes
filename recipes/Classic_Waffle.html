        <h2>Descrition</h2>
        <p>A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. There are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe used. Waffles are eaten throughout the world, particularly in Belgium, which has over a dozen regional varieties.
            Waffles may be made fresh or simply heated after having been commercially cooked and frozen.</p> 
        <p>The ancient Greeks invented the waffle. Archaeologists have discovered what appears to be ancient waffle irons in Greek ruins. 
            These irons look like two plates with handles that were used to grill cakes.
            The Greek waffle was quite different from the breakfast dish we know and love today. The Greeks called their waffles obelios, and they were more savory than sweet. The obelio became the oublie during Medieval Europe. The recipe evolved as well, as people began to add spices and honey to give it more flavor and yeast to make it thicker. It eventually took on the name wafel.
            The Dutch made the wafel into the waffle we know today. They invented the grid shape in the iron to give the waffle its iconic pattern. Although it’s suspected they were trying to make a larger waffle with less batter, no one is sure why. The Dutch brought the waffle to America, where it gained even more popularity.</p>
