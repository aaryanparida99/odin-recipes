    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French onion soup (French: soupe à l’oignon) is a type of soup usually based on meat stock and onions, and often served gratinéed with croutons or a larger piece of bread covered with cheese floating on top. Although ancient in origin, the dish underwent a resurgence of popularity in the 1960s in the United States due to a greater interest in French cuisine. French onion soup may be served as a meal in itself or as a first course.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Add onions; cook, stirring constantly, until golden, 15 to 30 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour into the saucepan; cook, stirring constantly, until onions are coated, about 5 minutes.

        <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
